# CVE-2023-28615

This is a placeholder repo for a buffer overflow vuln I found in a network device.
The CVE is reserved but unpublished while waiting for the vendor to fix the vulnerability.

Once it has been fixed, I plan to upload a fuller description of the vulnerability to here, and have the CVE link here.
